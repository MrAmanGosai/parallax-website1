            Parallax scrolling is a visual effect where the background of 
            a web page appears to stay still while the foreground shifts 
            vertically or horizontally. Parallax scrolling is used to add 
            visual interest to a website and engage users as they scroll
             through a web page.<br><br>

              site’s design and interactivity manage to inject much of
              Chris’ personality into what could have otherwise been a
              dry list of skills, experience, and education history.<br><br>

              It is also known as a  Computer graphics technique, where background 
              images move past the camera more slowly than foreground images,
              creating an illusion of depth in a 2D scene and adding to the sense
              of immersion in the virtual experience. Parallax scrolling is

              Parallax scrolling is a technique in computer graphics where 
              background images move past the camera more slowly than foreground
              images, creating an illusion of depth in a 2D scene of distance.
              [1] The technique grew out of the multiplane camera technique 
              used in traditional animation[2] since the 1930s.<br><br>

              Parallax scrolling was popularized in 2D computer graphics 
              with its introduction to video games in the early 1980s. Some
              parallax scrolling was used in the arcade video game Jump
              Bug (1981).[3] It used a limited form of parallax scrolling
              with the main scene scrolling while the starry night sky 
              is fixed and clouds move slowly, adding depth to the
              scenery. The following year, Moon Patrol (1982) 
              implemented a full form of parallax scrolling, with 
              three separate background layers scrolling at different 
              speeds, simulating the distance between them.[4] Moon
              Patrol is often credited with popularizing parallax 
              scrolling.[5][6] Jungle King (1982), later called 
              Jungle Hunt, also had parallax scrolling,[7] and was 
              released a month after Moon Patrol in June 1982.[8]<br><br>
